-> Produce the data to a topic say "SS_Topic" and validate the data

e.g. Produce a record with "key":"email", "value":"sarvesh.sharmaa@outlook.com"


-> Consume from the same topic i.e. "SS_Topic" and validate records

Read or consume from the same topic and validate/assert the data

We can do this by bringing up Kafka in dockerized containers or by pointing our tests to any 
integrated test environment somewhere in Kubernetes-Kafka cluster or any other microservices infrastructure.
